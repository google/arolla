  The overload condition is similar to the qtype constraint (see
  BackendOperator). A condition can reference the parameters' qtypes using
  placeholders, such as P.param_name, and must return present() or missing() to
  indicate whether the condition is met. The distinction from qtype_constraints
  is that an unmet condition does not imply an error.

  A condition can also use L.input_tuple_qtype, which represents types of all
  inputs using a single tuple_qtype value, where the unknown qtypes represented
  with NOTHING.

  The prepared overload expression contains no placeholders, and only use
  L.input_tuple_qtype. The prepared overload expression also
  contains checks for length and presence of elements in L.input_tuple_qtype.
