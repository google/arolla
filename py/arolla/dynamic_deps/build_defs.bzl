    """Python extension that dynamically loads `cc_library`es.

    This macro is intended as a helper that dynamically loads components such
    as Arolla types, serialization codecs, and operators. These components are
    usually implemented as cc_library() targets.

    The resulting python extension must be manually loaded from a .py file.

    Extensions created using this macro share the same instances of
    the following libraries:

      * py/arolla/operators (!)
      * py/arolla:py_abc
      * Arolla (particularly, the operator registry)
      * Abseil
      * Protobuf

    IMPORTANT: It is crucial that each cc_library() is provided by at most one
    Python extension. Failing to do so can easily lead to collisions between
    dynamically loaded symbols at runtime!

    As a rule of thumb, if a cc_library() is wrapped using arolla_py_cc_deps(),
    no other targets in the Python API should directly depend on it.

    In general, the same rule applies to implicit dependencies. However, when
    there is a conflict between implicit dependencies, the conflicts need to be
    investigated on a case-by-case basis.
