  """Constructs an expression that runs a loop.

  Args:
    initial_state: a dict from the loop internal state variable names to their
      initial values (expressions or literals).
    condition: an expression that returns OptionalUnit indicating whether the
      loop has to be continued.
    body: a dict from the loop internal state variable names to expressions
      evaluating their next values.
    maximum_iterations: maximum number of loop iterations. When the limit is
      reached the last state of the loop is returned without raising an error.

  Returns:
    An expression computing a namedtuple with the final state of the loop.

  The `condition` and `body` expressions can use placeholders named as loop
  internal state variables. All other placeholders are prohibited.

  Usage example (computes GCD of L.a and L.b):

    from arolla.experimental import while_loop

    gcd = M.namedtuple.get_field(
        while_loop.while_loop(
            initial_state=dict(x=L.a, y=L.b),
